# Churn-Rate-Prediction
The aim of this project is to predict the Churn rate in the Telco sector.

The Churn rate, when applied to a customer base, refers to the proportion of contractual customers or subscribers who leave a supplier during a given time period. It is a possible indicator of customer dissatisfaction, cheaper and/or better offers from the competition, more successful sales and/or marketing by the competition, or reasons having to do with the customer life cycle.

Churn analysis is a predictive analysis that makes it possible to identify customers who are more likely to switch to competitors, in order to intervene in advance and avoid their migration.

The aim of this project is to find the best classification model, capable of correctly predicting if a customer wants or not to leave the service.

The dataset is taken from here https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/blastchar/telco-customer-churn?datasetId=13996&sortBy=voteCount
